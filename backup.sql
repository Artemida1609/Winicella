1	The Guv'nor, Spain	We asked some of our most prized winemakers working in Spain to make the best wines possible – no rules, no restrictions, no red tape. The Guv'nor collection was their answer. Made from Tempranillo grapes picked from their favourite vineyards across Spain, it’s a crowd-pleasing wine designed to be shared with good food – and even better company. It’s bold. It’s fruity. It’s a modern Spanish red that goes with everything, especially spicy barbecue meats or anything chargrilled.	9.99	Red	14	NV	Spain	nan	Tempranillo	Vanilla, Blackberry, Blackcurrant	Rich & Juicy	750	
2	Bread & Butter 'Winemaker's Selection' Chardonnay 2020/21, California	This really does what it says on the tin. It’s a lush Chardonnay which tastes of – you guessed it – bread and butter. The winemaking team combine grapes from two very different regions to create something full but fresh. Monterey is known for its big Chardonnays, but Carneros is far cooler, so flavours are more understated. And you'll taste the benefits in this bold and buttery wine. It’s silky smooth with fresh notes of citrus and vanilla. It’s incredibly versatile, but we like it best with creamy tarragon chicken or soft, creamy cheese.	15.99	White	13.5	2021	USA	California	Chardonnay	Vanilla, Almond, Coconut, Green Apple, Peach, Pineapple, Stone Fruit	Rich & Toasty	750	
3	Oyster Bay Sauvignon Blanc 2022, Marlborough	Oyster Bay has been an award-winning gold-standard Marlborough Sauvignon since its very first vintage, and it’s only got better and better. It was even formerly named the ‘Best Sauvignon Blanc in the World’ – and they have the name recognition to prove it. It’s really no surprise then that their Sauvignon is textbook Marlborough. Big. Fruity. Tropical. To say it’s mouth-wateringly refreshing is an understatement – the smell of gooseberries and lime will hit you the minute you unscrew the bottle. It’s really versatile – delicious as a glassful on sofa, for parties or with a flaky goat’s cheese tart.\n\nIn 2022, this wine won an IWC award for the 2021 vintage.	12.49	White	13	2022	New Zealand	Marlborough	Sauvignon Blanc	Tropical Fruit, Gooseberry, Grapefruit, Grass, Green Apple, Lemon, Stone Fruit	Crisp & Zesty	750	
4	Louis Latour Mâcon-Lugny 2021/22	We’ve sold this wine for thirty years – and for that whole time it’s been a bestseller. Why’s it so popular? White Burgundy is a go-to for Chardonnay drinkers, and the Mâconnais in particular offers great value. Unlike the northern Côtes, the southern part of Burgundy doesn’t have a formalised vineyard hierarchy system. So the wines tend to be a bit more wallet-friendly. Not to mention, Lugny is one of the best regarded villages in the Mâcon, and Latour one of the most famous houses. Honeyed. Peachy. Crisp. A dream with salty finger foods or a classic Sunday roast chicken. It’s proof that sometimes it pays to stick with the old favourites.	17.99	White	13.5	2022	France	Burgundy	Chardonnay	Peach, Apricot, Floral, Lemon	Ripe & Rounded	750	
5	Bread & Butter 'Winemaker's Selection' Pinot Noir 2021, California	Bread & Butter is that thing that you can count on. It’s dependable, comforting – you know what to expect. That’s exactly what you’ll get with this wine, a textbook Californian Pinot Noir from the same winery which brought you the sell-out Bread & Butter Chardonnay. Their vineyards are ideally located for classic varieties like Pinot. It’s sun-drenched, but cooled by the daily morning mists which roll in off the Pacific. It’s exactly the sort of position that pernickety Pinot thrives in. This deliciously silky wine proves our point. It’s all about red fruit. Cherries. Raspberries. Cranberries. It’s seriously juicy and seriously delicious, with a nice fullness which is classic California. Oak ageing gives it a touch of cedary spice, and woody herb notes. Perfect with roast mushrooms.	15.99	Red	13.5	2021	USA	California	Pinot Noir	Smoke, Black Cherry, Cedar, Raspberry, Red Fruit	Smooth & Mellow	750	
6	Louis Roederer 'Cristal' Champagne 2015	Cristal is Louis Roederer’s flagship wine. It was first made in 1876, when Tsar Alexander II asked the house to reserve their best cuvee for him every year. But he had another request. Fearful of an assassination attempt, he asked that it be produced in a clear bottle with no indent, called a ‘punt’, in the bottom. And an icon was born. It’s made from seven Grand Crus and only in the best years, when low-yielding Pinot Noir and Chardonnay vines produce perfectly ripe grapes. Rich and velvety, it has intense and complex notes of ripe citrus, golden apple and almond pastry with an incredibly long and elegant finish.	300	White	12	2015	France	nan	Chardonnay	nan	nan	750	
7	La Gioiosa Prosecco DOC, Treviso	In Treviso, Prosecco’s heartland, the locals have a motto to describe their home – ‘marca gioiosa et amorosa’, it’s a ‘joyful and loving’ place. It inspired the Moretti Polegato family when they needed a name for their wine business. They’ve been making Prosecco for three generations and wanted a name that tied them to the land which had given them so much. ‘Gioiosa’ – ‘joyful’ was the perfect fit. These lively bubbles are wonderfully refreshing with notes of white blossom, pear and peachy stone fruit. The perfect apéritif or party wine – and delicious with canapés.\n\nIn 2022, this wine won an IWC award.	12.99	White	11	NV	Italy	Prosecco Doc	Glera	Green Apple, Citrus Fruit, Floral	Light & Refreshing	750	
8	The Macallan Sherry Oak 12 Year Old Single Malt Whisky 70cl	The Macallan’s rich heritage dates back to 1824 – they were one of the first distilleries in Scotland to be legally licensed. Since then they’ve built up a name as one of the world’s leading producers of single malt whisky. And their stellar reputation is down to their stringent standards for using the very best oak. This spends 12 years maturing in Oloroso sherry casks hand-picked by Macallan’s Master of Wood. The result? A complex sherried whisky with rich flavours of orange peel, dried fruit, vanilla, woodsmoke and spice.\n\nDue to high demand, there is a limited number of cases/bottles currently available online – please contact your local store or our customer contact centre at 0345 605 6767  if you wish to purchase more.	80	Brown	40	NV	Scotland	nan	nan	nan	nan	700	
9	Bouvet Ladubay Saumur Brut	The Loire Valley’s Saumur Brut is the go-to appellation if you like premium sparkling wine – but not the high price tag. And this one is hands down our most popular bottle. Over its rich history, Bouvet Ladubay has been endorsed by Napoleon III and chosen as official supplier to the House of Lords. They specialise in bringing out the floral notes of Chenin Blanc, and it certainly shows in this lively, zesty fizz. Expect notes of honeysuckle, apple and lime, with a crisp, fresh finish.\n\nIn 2022, this wine won an IWC award	13.99	White	12.5	NV	France	Loire	Chenin Blanc	Honeysuckle, Citrus Fruit	Rich & Toasty	750	
10	LB7 Red 2020/21, Lisbon	Portuguese red blends are a Majestic speciality. They're easy-drinking, rich, packed with juicy fruit flavours and great value. Not to mention, they're a bit out of the ordinary. We looked for a blend of indigenous local grape varieties to give you something a little different and a lot more exciting. And we've really stepped up our game with this exclusive bottling. It's made by one of Portugal's most-awarded producers in homage to Lisbon's legendary food scene. It's big. It's bold. It's very drinkable – all brambly fruit with a kick of spice. Plus, it'll enhance any richly flavoured food you throw at it, whether that's barbecue or a warming casserole.\n\nIn 2022, this wine won an IWC award for the 2019 vintage.	8.99	Red	13.5	2021	Portugal	Lisboa	Castelão	Spice, Black Fruit, Black Plum, Blackberry	Rich & Juicy	750	
11	The Ned 'Waihopai River' Sauvignon Blanc 2023, Marlborough	Our bestselling white wine. Winemaker Brent Marris’ father was the first person to plant Sauvignon vines in Marlborough. Brent has had just as big an impact on Kiwi Sauvignon. He’s got rafts of awards to show for it, and that certainly reflects here. It’s the most refreshing thing you could pour into your glass. Full of gooseberry and grapefruit flavours, it’s grassy, tropical and seriously aromatic.

The sale included some of the original vineyards which had been planted by Benedictine monks in the 1730s. And the rest is history. This is a classic Champagne, full of honeysuckle, brioche and pear flavours. Taittinger was Bond’s Champagne of choice in the original novels, so try it with something equally sophisticated.

They’ve more than succeeded – and they’re now regarded as Shiraz experts. ‘Angels' Share’ was one of their very first wines.

It’s a tough place to make wine – so it’s no surprise that there are only a few commercial wineries here. Winemaker Giorgio Flessati’s Italian roots have heavily influenced the way they make wine. In fact, this is the first appassimento Carménère in the world, made by leaving the grapes to dry until the flavours are much more pronounced. Black pepper. Plum. Fig. It’s incredibly rich, with plenty of black-fruit flavours and subtle sweetness from the dried grapes.

It’s made from traditional grape varieties Loureiro, Arinto, Trajadura and Avesso grown in Portugal's coolest region in the far north of the country. Here, the cooling influence of the Atlantic helps create wines that have the perfect balance of aromatic intensity and freshness. It’s crisp and dry, with a mouthwatering minerality. Relatively low in alcohol at 11% with a touch of residual sweetness, it’s an ideal pairing for fresh seafood dishes.	8.99	White	11	2022	Portugal	Vinho Verde	Loureiro	Citrus Fruit, Green Apple, Lemon	Crisp & Zesty	750	
92	Gabriel Allard Côtes du Rhône Rouge 2022	Les Grandes Serres winery specialises in wines from the picturesque Southern Rhône Valley. With a new and enthusiastic team, modern cellars and careful maturation practises, Les Grandes Serres make internationally renowned wines that showcase the best of the region. Our Rhône buyer tasted this blind – and immediately fell in love. And once you try it, it’s easy to see why. Expect bold, juicy red-and black-fruit flavours with hints of spice. Its rich structure and herby notes make it a fantastic pairing with beef.	9.99	Red	14.5	2022	France	Rhône	Grenache	Black Pepper, Black Plum, Red Fruit	Smooth & Mellow	750	
93	Alain Jaume 'Roquedon' Organic Lirac 2018/19	The Jaume family have been making wine for over 100 years. Based in Châteauneuf-du-Pape, they’re dedicated to showcasing the best of the southern Rhône Valley. Lirac lies just across the river from their famed homeland, so it’s no surprise that the family decided to make wine there too. And this delicious bottling does their reputation proud. It’s made with hand-picked organic grapes, and is partially aged in oak for extra smoothness and complexity. Discover ripe red- and black-fruit flavours with touches of spice, vanilla and liquorice. Its silky tannins make it an ideal pairing for red meats like lamb or venison.	18.99	Red	15	2019	France	Rhône	Grenache	Spice, Black Plum, Blackberry, Earth, Raspberry	Bold & Spicy	750	
94	Mirabeau 'Pure' Rosé 2021/22 Magnum, Côtes de Provence	True to its title, Mirabeau Pure Provence Rosé is renowned for its distinctive purity. It’s a classic blend of Grenache and Syrah, gently pressed and lovingly crafted to express its refined and elegant flavours. This attention to detail has won it wide critical acclaim. Expect lush notes of pink grapefruit and summer berries, with a hint of minerality on the finish. Mirabeau lovingly calls this 'Provence in a glass'. It'll make a fantastic partner for light fish dishes.	37.99	Rosé	13	2022	France	Provence	Grenache	Herbaceous, Peach, Raspberry, Strawberry	Delicate & Dry	\N	
95	Jim Barry 'The Lodge Hill' Riesling 2021/22, Clare Valley	Jim Barry purchased the land for The Lodge Hill vineyard in 1977 as he was sure it would produce some of the best Riesling in the Clare Valley. The plot sits high above sea-level. Grapes here are exposed to concentrated sunlight and cool nights which encourage gradual, slow ripening. The process helps retain the key characteristics of Riesling – fresh acidity and plenty of citrus. Come harvest time, gentle pressing preserves those natural flavours. The end result is mouthwatering. Dry, crisp and full of lemon, lime and grapefruit. Delicious alongside fresh seafood.	15.99	White	12.5	2022	Australia	South Australia	Riesling	Petrol, Citrus Fruit, Grapefruit, Green Apple, Honeysuckle, Lemon, Lime, Orange, Peach, Pear	Fresh & Elegant	750	
96	Nettie Viognier 2019/21, California	If you love floral, fragrant, full-bodied whites then this delicious Viognier is an absolute must-try. California’s Viogniers fly a bit under-the-radar, so it’s a real bargain. It’s named ‘Nettie’ after Miss Nettie Valear who planted an acorn on the site of the now-vineyard in memory of Abraham Lincoln. Now a majestic oak, it’s a reminder that while California feels relatively ‘New World’, wine has been made there for more than two centuries. Classic varieties like Viognier flourish there. This wine is a case in point – it’s full of character. It’s big. It’s lush. It’s fruity. Full of peach and apricot flavours, with a really rich, round texture. Excellent with Thai spiced chicken or shellfish.	11.99	White	14	2021	USA	California	Viognier	Pear, Apricot, Floral, Honey, Peach	Aromatic & Floral	750	
97	Thierry Delaunay 'Manoir' Sauvignon Blanc 2021/22, Touraine	The Loire is Sauvignon Blanc’s homeland. So it’s no surprise that Loire native Thierry Delaunay is passionate about the grape. Decades of family winemaking in the region means he has the pick of the crop when it comes to choosing grapes for his wines. He looks for the best grapes from the best pockets of vines in Touraine – and the results speak for themselves. This Sauvignon is seriously refreshing, seriously citrusy, and seriously good value. You’ll find nothing finer to pair with a goat’s cheese tart. And its more restrained flavour profile – less ripe and fruity than the standard Kiwi Sauvignon – makes it a perfect party wine.\n\nIn 2022, this wine won an IWC award for the 2021 vintage.	12.99	White	13	2022	France	Loire	Sauvignon Blanc	Green Apple, Citrus Fruit, Grass	Fresh & Elegant	750	
98	Lanson Le Black Label Brut Champagne Magnum	With over 260 years of winemaking history, Lanson is one of the oldest Champagne houses. Queen Victoria gave the wines her seal of approval in 1900, issuing the house with a Royal Warrant. Le Black Label was then created in 1937 to honour the Royal Household. The Brut went on to become Lanson’s most famous cuvée – and you can now enjoy it in a double-sized bottle. The smart box also makes this a fantastic statement gift. It has toasty and delicate floral aromas that lead to flavours of ripe fruit, honey and refreshing citrus. The bubbles are fine and persistent, making Le Black Label a highly elegant Champagne that's sure to impress.	99.99	White	12.5	NV	France	nan	Chardonnay	Bread, Citrus Fruit, Honey	Crisp & Fruity	\N	
99	Wind and Waves Alvarinho 2022, Vinho Verde DOC	Quinta da Calçada are one of the oldest producers in Vinho Verde’s Amarante region. The Lago Cerqueira family built their cellars here in 1917 – and over a century later, their wines have gone from strength to strength. This is an elegant expression of Alvarinho—known in Spain as Albariño— thanks to the subregion’s high elevation. Due to the vineyard’s lofty altitudes, grapes benefit from the warm, sunny days and cooler nighttime temperatures. The result? Ripe, juicy flavour balanced by a refreshing acidity. Expect floral hints and notes of tropical fruit and citrus. The refreshing acidity and minerality makes it a great part for fried fish dishes like calamari or fresh sushi and sashimi.	11.99	White	12	2022	Portugal	nan	Alvarinho	Citrus Fruit, Floral, Tropical Fruit	Crisp & Zesty	750	
100	Lanson Le Blanc de Blancs Brut Champagne	With a Royal Warrant and status as the official fizz of Wimbledon, Lanson is one of the Champagne world’s most recognisable names. Such a big reputation demands top quality. That’s why the house sources its grapes for this Blanc de Blancs from a selection of the region's best Chardonnay vineyards. Grapes from Côte des Blancs bring finesse and elegance, while those from Montagne de Reims add body and richness – the perfect balance. Discover vibrant aromas of pear, marzipan and candied citrus. A note of chalky minerality makes these fine bubbles all the more elegant.	75.99	White	12.5	NV	France	nan	Chardonnay	nan	nan	750
